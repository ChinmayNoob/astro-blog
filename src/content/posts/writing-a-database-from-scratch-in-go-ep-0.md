## I will be building a Database from scratch in Golang

I don't know how im gonna do it or will i be able to do it.But in 2025 apart from the things im doing i really wanted to make a database of my own. I will be choosing Golang to make it i have my hands dirty with golang earlier but will need to get my grip on that language. 

This is not related to anything i'm doing this because i'm passionate about this stuff.

This are some of the things / resources i have found out while coming to this idea 

1. Golang Official [Docs](https://go.dev/doc/)
2. [CMU Intro to Database Systems (15-445/645 - Fall 2024)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYDBpQnSymaectKjxCy6BYq&si=l_m7axoZJ6_WAtj-)
3. [CS186Berkley](https://www.youtube.com/@CS186Berkeley/playlists)
4. [Designing Data Intensive Application](https://dataintensive.net/)
5. [Red Book](http://www.redbook.io/)
6. [Database Internals](https://www.databass.dev/)
7. Cockroach DB [Blogs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/) and [Repo](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach)

With that been shared I will start this journey slowly i don't care if it takes 4 months or 5 months to build this.I just want to have fun while building this.

I will have a seperate timeframe for this in my week,will start by reading Go Docs , building small projects. 

Keep building and have fun, anon.
